 Not A Big Bang Theory

Introduction
============

::

   Ever since the dawn of civilisation, people have not ben conten to
   see events as unconnected and inexplicable.

   They have craved an understanding of the underlying order in the
   world.

   Today we still yearn to know why we are here and where we came
   from.

   Humanity's deepest desire for knowledge is justification enough for
   our continuing quest.

   And our goal is nothing less than a complete description pf the
   universe we live in.

   Stephen W. Hawking, A Brief History of Time.

So here we go..

The importance of an open mind in science.

And being prepared to be spectacularly wrong, as that is also the only
way to be spectacularly right.

Rapa Nui
========

A remote island over 1000 miles west of the coast of Chile, and its
people.

Also known as the naval of the world, and with good reason.

It is a volcanic island rising from the depths of the Pacific ocean.

It is most famous for the giant stone statues, Moai, that are all over
the island.


Moai, Mana and magnets
======================

The giant moai, some as much as 80 tonnes, were mostly carved from
soft volcanic tuft on the slopes of the Rana Raraku volcano.

They are carved out horizontally, then turned through 90 degrees to be
stood up.

Around half of the Moai are on platforms called *ahu's*.  They all
face inland and are around the coast of the island.

There are many other Moai not on platforms.  I believe all the larger
moai are on platforms, or abandoned in the quary.

When Europeans arrived on the island in the 1700's they asked the
islanders how the moai were moved from the quary to the coast.

The answer?::

  they walked on their own powered by Mana


I believe that the islanders may have been correct and that Mana is in
fact magnetism.

Rongo Rongo
===========

Undeciphered text from Rapa Nui.

Eventually the Europeans got round to asking if anyone could read
these strange tablets.

The reply::

  we would love to help you but all those that could read the tablets
  are now dead

  we believe they may have been chants

Again, lets go with the experts, the people who actually live on the
island.

These rongo rongo tablets were apparently found in many of the homes
on the island.

So chants would make sense.

Lots more to come on rongo rongo, including are the tablets bus timetables?

Inertia in society.

Good theories, systems that work for everyone remove the need to find
better solutions.

Excel.  Even python (ok only joking).
